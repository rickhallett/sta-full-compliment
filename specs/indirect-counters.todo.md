## Notes for Implementation

1. **Prioritize CRITICAL tasks** - These form the foundation
2. **Work in parallel** where possible within priority tiers
3. **Document everything** - Evidence is crucial
4. **Test responses** before they're needed
5. **Build redundancy** into all systems
6. **Maintain professional tone** throughout
7. **Focus on facts** over rhetoric
8. **Prepare for long campaign** - This won't be quick

## Additional Resources Needed
