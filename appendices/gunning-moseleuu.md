Here’s a concise standalone piece you can drop straight into your “musket” pack. It explains the **Gunning principles** and their reaffirmation in **R (Moseley) v Haringey LBC \[2014] UKSC 56**, with just enough legal bite for a formal complaint.

## The Gunning Principles and *Moseley*: Fairness in Public Consultation

### Origin of the Gunning Principles

The **Gunning Principles** derive from the case of *R v Brent LBC ex p Gunning* (1985) 84 LGR 168, later endorsed by the Court of Appeal in *R v North and East Devon Health Authority ex p Coughlan* \[2001] QB 213. They have since become the recognised common-law test for whether a public consultation meets the standard of procedural fairness.

The four principles are:

1. **At a formative stage** — Proposals must be at a genuinely formative stage before consultation begins. The decision-maker must not have already decided the outcome.
2. **Sufficient information** — Consultees must have enough information to give intelligent consideration and an intelligent response.
3. **Adequate time** — There must be adequate time for consultation, considering the nature and complexity of the subject.
4. **Conscientious consideration** — The decision-maker must give conscientious consideration to the consultation responses before making a final decision.

Failure to satisfy any of these principles may render a consultation unlawful.

### *R (Moseley) v Haringey LBC* \[2014] UKSC 56 — Supreme Court Confirmation

In *Moseley*, the Supreme Court reaffirmed the Gunning Principles as the standard for lawful consultation. The case concerned Haringey’s consultation on Council Tax reduction schemes. The Court held that fairness sometimes requires not just presenting a preferred option, but also providing information about **rejected alternatives** and their reasons, so consultees can make meaningful representations.

Key points from *Moseley*:

* The Gunning Principles remain the core test for consultation lawfulness.
* Fairness is a flexible standard, applied contextually, but authorities may be required to explain **options and reasons** beyond their preferred proposal.
* Information must be presented in a way that does not mislead or constrain meaningful participation.

### Application to the Swanage Consultation

Applying the Gunning/Moseley framework to the **mid-consultation introduction of a CAPTCHA**:

* **Formative Stage** — Adding a barrier part-way through may signal procedural drift, suggesting changes to access while the process is ongoing, potentially undermining the perception of openness.
* **Sufficient Information** — No prior notice or explanation of the CAPTCHA’s purpose means consultees could not understand the change or how to navigate it effectively.
* **Adequate Time** — Imposing a new access barrier without extending the consultation period shortens effective participation time for some users, especially those needing alternative formats or assistance.
* **Conscientious Consideration** — Responses collected after the barrier may not be demographically representative, risking a decision based on skewed evidence.

Under *Moseley*, fairness requires both transparency about process changes and consideration of viable alternatives. In this case, if non-CAPTCHA mitigations were available but not explained or trialled, the principles are likely breached.
