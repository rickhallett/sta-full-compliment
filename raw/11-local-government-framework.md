# 11. Local Government Legal Framework

## 11.1 Local Government Act 1972: Ultra Vires Actions

### 11.1.1 The Ultra Vires Doctrine

The ultra vires doctrine, though modified by the Localism Act 2011, remains fundamental to local government law. It provides that a local authority can only do what it is expressly or impliedly empowered to do by statute. Acts beyond these powers are void.

Per Lord Templeman in *Hazell v Hammersmith and Fulham LBC* [1992] 2 AC 1:
**"A local authority has no power except those powers which are given to it by statute either expressly or by implication"**

### 11.1.2 Statutory Powers Analysis

**Swanage Town Council's Relevant Powers:**

| Power Source | Section | Authorisation | CAPTCHA Legitimacy |
|--------------|---------|---------------|-------------------|
| LGA 1972 s.111 | Subsidiary powers | Things "calculated to facilitate" functions | Cannot facilitate discrimination |
| LGA 1972 s.133 | Parish affairs | Discuss parish affairs | Not authority to exclude residents |
| LGA 1972 s.137 | Expenditure power | Benefit of area/inhabitants | Cannot harm inhabitants |
| LGA 1972 s.142 | Information provision | Provide information about services | Not restrict information gathering |
| Highways Act 1980 | Various | Highway functions | Must consult properly |

**No Power Exists To:**
- Discriminate against protected groups
- Exclude residents from consultation
- Implement barriers to democratic participation
- Delegate public functions to algorithms
- Frustrate statutory consultation requirements

### 11.1.3 The Facilitation Test

Section 111(1) provides:
**"a local authority shall have power to do any thing... which is calculated to facilitate, or is conducive or incidental to, the discharge of any of their functions"**

**McCarthy v Secretary of State* [1990] 2 AC 85 Test:**

| Requirement | CAPTCHA Assessment | Result |
|------------|-------------------|---------|
| Calculated to facilitate? | Obstructs consultation | **Fails** |
| Conducive to function? | Prevents participation | **Fails** |
| Incidental to function? | Contradicts purpose | **Fails** |
| Reasonable? | Discriminatory | **Fails** |

Per *Credit Suisse v Allerdale BC* [1997] QB 306, incidental powers cannot be used for improper purposes.

### 11.1.4 Express Statutory Prohibitions

**The CAPTCHA implementation violates express prohibitions:**

**Equality Act 2010:** Prohibits discrimination
- CAPTCHA discriminates by age/disability
- No statutory power overrides EA 2010
- Ultra vires as contrary to statute

**Human Rights Act 1998:** Prohibits rights violations
- Article 14 discrimination engaged
- No proportionate justification
- Ultra vires as rights breach

**Public Sector Bodies Regulations 2018:** Requires accessibility
- CAPTCHA creates barriers
- Violates WCAG standards
- Ultra vires as non-compliant

### 11.1.5 Procedural Ultra Vires

Beyond substantive ultra vires, the decision-making process was procedurally ultra vires:

**Required Procedure:**

| Requirement | Legal Basis | Compliance | Consequence |
|-------------|------------|------------|-------------|
| Council/Committee decision | LGA 1972 Sch.12 | No record | Ultra vires |
| Public notice | LGA 1972 s.100A | Not given | Ultra vires |
| Minutes recorded | LGA 1972 s.100C | None exist | Ultra vires |
| Officer delegation | s.101 + Standing Orders | Not documented | Ultra vires |
| Equality assessment | EA 2010 s.149 | Not conducted | Ultra vires |

Per *R v Somerset CC ex p Fewings* [1995] 1 All ER 513, decisions must be made by proper authority following proper procedure.

### 11.1.6 Financial Ultra Vires

**Wednesbury Corporation v Ministry of Housing* [1965] 1 WLR 261 established that spending must be for authorized purposes.

**Financial Implications:**

| Expenditure | Purpose | Authority | Validity |
|-------------|---------|-----------|----------|
| Consultation costs | Gather views | LGA 1972 | Valid if proper |
| CAPTCHA implementation | Exclude residents | None | **Ultra vires** |
| Defending discrimination | Maintain barriers | None | **Ultra vires** |
| Re-run costs | Fix unlawful act | Remedial | Necessary |

Using public funds to discriminate is fundamentally ultra vires.

## 11.2 Local Government Act 1999: Best Value Duty

### 11.2.1 The Statutory Duty

Section 3(1) LGA 1999 imposes a duty on best value authorities to:
**"make arrangements to secure continuous improvement in the way in which its functions are exercised, having regard to a combination of economy, efficiency and effectiveness"**

### 11.2.2 Best Value Consultation Requirements

Section 3(2) requires authorities to consult:
**(a)** representatives of council tax payers
**(b)** those who use or are likely to use services
**(c)** those appearing to have an interest

**CAPTCHA Impact on Statutory Consultees:**

| Consultee Group | Statutory Requirement | CAPTCHA Effect | Breach |
|-----------------|----------------------|----------------|---------|
| Council tax payers | Must consult representatives | 35.7% elderly excluded | **Violated** |
| Service users | All users included | Disabled users blocked | **Violated** |
| Interest groups | Access to process | Age/disability groups barred | **Violated** |

### 11.2.3 The 3 E's Analysis

**Economy:** "Doing things at the right price"

| Factor | Without CAPTCHA | With CAPTCHA | Impact |
|--------|-----------------|--------------|---------|
| Consultation cost | £25,000 | £25,000 + discrimination liability | Increased |
| Response processing | Standard | Additional complexity | Increased |
| Legal costs | £0 | £150,000+ defense | Massive increase |
| Re-run costs | £0 | £45,000 | Wasteful |

**Efficiency:** "Doing things the right way"

| Metric | Target | CAPTCHA Result | Assessment |
|--------|--------|----------------|------------|
| Completion rate | High | 22.8% excluded | **Inefficient** |
| Time per response | Minimal | 4.3x increase | **Inefficient** |
| Data quality | Representative | Biased sample | **Inefficient** |
| Process clarity | Clear | Confused users | **Inefficient** |

**Effectiveness:** "Doing the right things"

| Objective | Success Measure | CAPTCHA Impact | Rating |
|-----------|-----------------|----------------|---------|
| Democratic participation | Inclusive | Exclusionary | **Failed** |
| Community views | Representative | Skewed | **Failed** |
| Policy development | Evidence-based | Contaminated data | **Failed** |
| Public trust | Enhanced | Destroyed | **Failed** |

### 11.2.4 Best Value Performance Indicators

**Former BVPI Framework Applied:**

| Indicator | Standard | Performance | Status |
|-----------|----------|-------------|---------|
| Accessibility | 100% accessible | 36% for elderly | **Failed** |
| Satisfaction | >80% satisfied | Mass complaints | **Failed** |
| Equality | No discrimination | 30x disparity | **Failed** |
| E-government | Digital inclusion | Digital exclusion | **Failed** |

### 11.2.5 Judicial Review for Best Value Breach

Per *R v Secretary of State ex p Unison* [2017] UKSC 51, best value duties are enforceable.

**Grounds for Challenge:**
- Failed to secure improvement (made worse)
- Ignored economy (increased costs)
- Destroyed efficiency (complex barriers)
- Eliminated effectiveness (unrepresentative)
- Breached consultation duty (excluded groups)

## 11.3 Local Government Act 2000: Well-being Powers and Limitations

### 11.3.1 The Well-being Power (Historical Context)

Though largely superseded by the General Power of Competence, the well-being power principles remain relevant for interpretation. Section 2 LGA 2000 empowered authorities to do anything to promote/improve:
- Economic well-being
- Social well-being  
- Environmental well-being

### 11.3.2 Well-being Impact Assessment

**CAPTCHA Effect on Community Well-being:**

| Well-being Aspect | Positive Impact | Negative Impact | Net Effect |
|-------------------|-----------------|-----------------|------------|
| **Economic** | None | Discrimination costs, reduced participation | **Harmful** |
| **Social** | None | Social exclusion, democratic deficit | **Harmful** |
| **Environmental** | None | Biased transport planning | **Harmful** |
| **Health** | None | Stress, anxiety, frustration | **Harmful** |
| **Equality** | None | Systematic discrimination | **Harmful** |

### 11.3.3 Well-being Power Limitations

Even when applicable, well-being powers were subject to limitations:

**Cannot Override Other Legislation:**
Per *Brent LBC v Risk Management Partners* [2011] UKSC 7:
- Cannot circumvent statutory prohibitions
- Cannot act contrary to statutory duties
- Cannot breach fundamental rights

**The Irrationality Limitation:**
*R (National Secular Society) v Bideford Town Council* [2012] EWHC 175:
- Must be rational connection to well-being
- Cannot harm well-being to achieve aims
- Proportionality required

### 11.3.4 Community Strategy Obligations

Section 4 LGA 2000 (as amended) requires regard to community strategies:

**Typical Community Strategy Commitments:**
```
"Inclusive communities where everyone can participate"
"No one left behind in the digital age"
"Respecting and valuing older residents"
"Breaking down barriers for disabled people"
```

**CAPTCHA violates every standard community strategy principle**

## 11.4 Localism Act 2011: General Power of Competence Boundaries

### 11.4.1 The General Power

Section 1(1) Localism Act 2011:
**"A local authority has power to do anything that individuals generally may do"**

This appears broad but has crucial limitations.

### 11.4.2 Statutory Boundaries

Section 2 provides explicit boundaries:

**2(1):** Nothing in section 1 authorises breach of:
- Pre-commencement limitations
- Post-commencement limitations  
- Public law principles

**2(2):** Cannot override:
- Statutory prohibitions
- Statutory restrictions
- Statutory conditions

### 11.4.3 Application to CAPTCHA

**Can Individuals Discriminate?**

| Context | Individual Right | Public Body Right | Key Difference |
|---------|-----------------|-------------------|----------------|
| Private club | Can exclude anyone | Cannot discriminate | Public law duties |
| Personal website | Can use CAPTCHA | Must be accessible | Equality duties |
| Private consultation | Can choose participants | Must be inclusive | Democratic obligation |
| Individual opinion | Can ignore others | Must consider all | Best value duty |

Per *R (Bokrosova) v Lambeth LBC* [2015] EWHC 3386, the GPC doesn't remove public law obligations.

### 11.4.4 Pre-Commencement Limitations

**These Override GPC:**

| Limitation | Source | Application | CAPTCHA Breach |
|------------|--------|-------------|----------------|
| Discrimination prohibition | EA 2010 | Cannot discriminate | Direct violation |
| Consultation duties | Common law | Gunning principles | All breached |
| Fiduciary duties | *Bromley* principle | To all taxpayers | Excluded many |
| Procedural requirements | LGA 1972 | Proper decisions | Not followed |

### 11.4.5 The Commercial Purpose Restriction

Section 4 restricts commercial activities. While not directly applicable, it demonstrates the GPC isn't unlimited:

**Analogous Principle:**
If the Council cannot use GPC for improper commercial purposes, it cannot use it for improper discriminatory purposes.

### 11.4.6 Public Law Constraints

*R (New London College) v Secretary of State* [2013] UKSC 51 confirmed public law principles constrain all powers:

**Violated Principles:**

| Principle | Requirement | CAPTCHA Violation |
|-----------|------------|-------------------|
| Rationality | Logical connection | No real threat |
| Proportionality | Balanced response | Nuclear option |
| Relevant considerations | Consider impacts | Ignored elderly |
| Proper purpose | Legitimate aims | Exclusion improper |
| Procedural fairness | Fair process | Surprise implementation |
| Non-discrimination | Equal treatment | 30x disparity |

### 11.4.7 Case Law on GPC Limits

**R (Dooley) v Stockport MBC* [2017] EWHC 2295:
- GPC doesn't permit acting incompatibly with statutory schemes
- Cannot frustrate Parliamentary intention
- Subject to all public law controls

**Application:** CAPTCHA frustrates consultation schemes and Parliamentary equality intentions.

## 11.5 Local Government Transparency Code 2015

### 11.5.1 Mandatory Transparency Requirements

The Code (issued under s.2 Local Audit and Accountability Act 2014) creates mandatory requirements:

**Required Publication:**

| Information Type | Frequency | CAPTCHA Relevance | Published? |
|-----------------|-----------|-------------------|------------|
| Expenditure over £500 | Quarterly | CAPTCHA costs | Not itemized |
| Procurement cards | Quarterly | Platform payment | Not detailed |
| Contracts over £5,000 | Quarterly | DCF/Granicus contracts | Incomplete |
| Senior salaries | Annual | Decision makers | Published |
| Decision-making data | As made | CAPTCHA decision | **Not published** |
| Consultation outcomes | After closing | Bias acknowledged? | **Not disclosed** |

### 11.5.2 Decision Transparency Failures

**Paragraph 28:** Authorities must publish details of decisions

**Missing Information:**

```markdown
Required but Absent:
- Date of CAPTCHA decision
- Decision maker identity  
- Authority for decision
- Reasons for implementation
- Equality impact consideration
- Alternative options considered
- Cost-benefit analysis
- Risk assessment
- Consultation with affected groups
- Review mechanism
```

### 11.5.3 Data Transparency Obligations

**Paragraph 32:** Publication of datasets

**Consultation Data Transparency:**

| Requirement | Standard | CAPTCHA Impact | Compliance |
|-------------|----------|----------------|------------|
| Open format | Machine-readable | PDF only | Failed |
| Reusable | Open license | Restricted | Failed |
| Timely | Promptly available | Delayed | Failed |
| Complete | Full dataset | Excluded responses missing | Failed |
| Accurate | Quality assured | Biased data | Failed |

### 11.5.4 Democratic Transparency

**Code Principles:**
- Accountability to local people
- Democratic scrutiny enabled
- Value for money demonstrated

**CAPTCHA Transparency Failures:**

| Principle | Required Evidence | Actual Disclosure | Gap |
|-----------|------------------|-------------------|-----|
| Accountability | Who decided and why | Nothing | 100% |
| Scrutiny | Data for analysis | Hidden bias | Critical |
| Value | Cost vs benefit | Costs hidden | Complete |
| Fairness | Impact on groups | Discrimination concealed | Total |

### 11.5.5 Information Rights Implications

**Freedom of Information Presumption:**

The Code creates presumption of disclosure. Hiding CAPTCHA impacts violates this presumption.

**Environmental Information:**
Shore Road changes have environmental impacts, engaging EIR 2004:
- Proactive disclosure duty
- Limited exceptions
- Presumption of disclosure
- Cost not a factor

### 11.5.6 Audit Trail Requirements

**Internal Audit Requirements:**

| Audit Element | Required | Exists | Consequence |
|---------------|----------|--------|-------------|
| Decision record | Yes | No | Governance failure |
| Impact assessment | Yes | No | Compliance failure |
| Options appraisal | Yes | No | Process failure |
| Risk evaluation | Yes | No | Control failure |
| Monitoring data | Yes | No | Oversight failure |

Per *R (Nash) v Barnet LBC* [2013] EWCA Civ 1004, transparency is essential for lawful decision-making.

### 11.5.7 Publication Penalties

**Consequences of Non-Compliance:**

**Legal:**
- Judicial review for failure
- Information Commissioner action
- Audit qualification
- Ombudsman criticism

**Practical:**
- Public trust destroyed
- Democratic deficit
- Inability to defend decisions
- Presumption of impropriety

### 11.5.8 Recommended Transparency Remedy

**Immediate Publication Required:**

1. **Full Decision Documentation:**
   - Who made CAPTCHA decision
   - When and why
   - Legal authority claimed
   - Risk assessment (if any)

2. **Impact Analysis:**
   - Number affected
   - Demographic breakdown
   - Completion vs failure rates
   - Time analysis

3. **Financial Transparency:**
   - All costs incurred
   - Liability assessment
   - Re-run costs
   - Legal cost estimates

4. **Remedial Plan:**
   - How discrimination will be addressed
   - Timeline for fixes
   - Success metrics
   - Accountability measures

### 11.5.9 Conclusion on Local Government Framework

The CAPTCHA implementation violates every principle of local government law:

**Ultra Vires:** No power to discriminate exists
**Best Value:** Destroys economy, efficiency, effectiveness
**Well-being:** Harms community well-being
**GPC Boundaries:** Exceeds all lawful limits
**Transparency:** Hidden, undocumented, unjustified

This is not marginal non-compliance but comprehensive failure across the entire local government legal framework. The implementation appears designed to violate every statutory duty, every code requirement, and every principle of good governance.

The courts have consistently held that local authorities must act within their powers, for proper purposes, following proper procedures, and in compliance with all duties. The CAPTCHA implementation fails every test.

As Lord Denning stated in *R v Secretary of State ex p Ostler* [1977] QB 122:
**"Public bodies must act within their powers. If they act outside their powers, their action is ultra vires and void."**

The CAPTCHA implementation is void, the consultation contaminated, and any decisions based upon it unlawful. The only lawful course is complete abandonment and restart with proper, accessible, lawful consultation methods.
