# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Overview

This repository contains a comprehensive legal analysis document addressing discriminatory access barriers implemented during a public consultation survey by Swanage Town Council. The document is structured as a formal legal case analysis with technical, legal, and regulatory components.

## Document Structure

The repository consists of markdown files organized into five main parts:

- **Part I: Factual Background** - Chronology, stakeholder analysis, demographic impact
- **Part II: Technical Analysis** - Security technology misapplication, engineering failures, statistical validity
- **Part III: Legal and Regulatory Breaches** - Equality Act, public law, WCAG, data protection, local government frameworks
- **Part IV: Harm Assessment and Remedies** - Quantified harm, remedial actions, regulatory next steps
- **Part V: Supporting Evidence** - Documentary evidence, expert analysis, case studies

## Working with This Repository

### Document Type
This is a legal document repository, not a software codebase. All files are markdown documents containing legal analysis, not executable code.

### Navigation Structure
- Main index: `README.md`
- Detailed contents: `contents.md`
- Each part has an overview file (e.g., `part-i-factual-background.md`)
- Individual sections in numbered files (e.g., `01-chronology-of-events.md`)
- Supporting materials: `appendices.md`, `schedule-of-demands.md`

### Key Considerations

1. **Legal Context**: This repository documents potential legal violations and discriminatory practices. Any modifications should maintain factual accuracy and legal precision.

2. **Cross-References**: Documents contain internal cross-references between sections. When editing, ensure consistency across related sections.

3. **Evidence-Based**: All claims are intended to be supported by evidence referenced in Part V. Maintain this evidence-based approach.

4. **Professional Tone**: The document maintains a formal, legal tone appropriate for regulatory submissions and potential court proceedings.

## Common Tasks

### Reviewing Content
When reviewing sections, consider:
- Legal accuracy and citation completeness
- Consistency with other sections
- Evidence support for claims made
- Compliance with relevant legal frameworks

### Updating Sections
When updating content:
- Maintain consistent formatting and structure
- Preserve legal terminology and precision
- Update cross-references if section numbers change
- Ensure factual accuracy is maintained

### Completed Research
Section 2 (Stakeholder Analysis) now contains comprehensive research on:
- **2.2 Dorset Coast Forum**: Agency law obligations, fiduciary duties, public sector extension
- **2.3 Granicus UK Ltd**: Service provider duties, WCAG compliance, professional standards
- **2.4 Chain of Liability**: Joint liability principles, regulatory enforcement, remedial obligations

### Adding New Content
If adding new sections or evidence:
- Follow existing numbering conventions
- Update `contents.md` with new entries
- Link from relevant overview files
