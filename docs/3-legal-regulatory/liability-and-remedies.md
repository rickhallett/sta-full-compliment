# Liability and Remedies Overview

## Legal Violations by Strength and Provability

### Tier 1: Core, High-Certainty Violations
- **Failure to Make Reasonable Adjustments (Equality Act s.20-22):** The anticipatory duty was clearly breached.
- **Breach of Public Sector Equality Duty (Equality Act s.149):** No evidence of an Equality Impact Assessment.
- **Breach of Consultation Fairness (Gunning Principles):** The mid-stream change made the process fundamentally unfair.

### Tier 2: Strong, Evidentiary Violations
- **Indirect Discrimination (Equality Act s.19):** Demonstrable disparate impact on protected groups.
- **Data Protection by Design (UK GDPR Art. 25):** Failure to embed accessibility and fairness into the system.

### Tier 3: Downstream Legal Risks and Potential Violations
- **Criminal Liability (Equality Act s.29JA):** The instruction to implement a discriminatory barrier presents a serious risk that may be considered for prosecution by relevant authorities.
