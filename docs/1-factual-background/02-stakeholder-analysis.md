## 2.1 Swanage Town Council: Statutory Duties and Responsibilities

### 2.1 Swanage Town Council: Statutory Duties and Responsibilities

#### 2.1.1 Constitutional Status and Vires

Swanage Town Council operates as a parish council under the Local Government Act 1972, exercising powers pursuant to s.111 (subsidiary powers) and various specific statutory provisions. As of 2024, the Council also exercises the General Power of Competence under s.1 of the Localism Act 2011, having satisfied the eligibility criteria set out in The Parish Councils (General Power of Competence) (Prescribed Conditions) Order 2012 (SI 2012/965).

This General Power of Competence, while broad, remains subject to:
- Pre-existing statutory limitations and duties
- Public law principles of reasonableness and proper purpose
- Fiduciary duties to local taxpayers
- Human rights and equality obligations

The decision to implement discriminatory access barriers to a public consultation exceeds these powers and constitutes an **ultra vires** act, being contrary to statutory duties detailed below.

#### 2.1.2 Public Sector Equality Duty (PSED)

As a public authority listed in Schedule 19 of the Equality Act 2010, Swanage Town Council is bound by the Public Sector Equality Duty under s.149, which requires the Council to have "due regard" to the need to:

**(a)** Eliminate discrimination, harassment, victimisation and any other conduct prohibited by the Act;
**(b)** Advance equality of opportunity between persons who share a relevant protected characteristic and persons who do not share it;
**(c)** Foster good relations between persons who share a relevant protected characteristic and persons who do not share it.

##### Specific Breaches Identified:

1. **Failure of Process** - Per *R (Bracking) v Secretary of State for Work and Pensions* [2013] EWCA Civ 1345, the duty requires:
   - Consideration **before** the decision is made
   - Consideration with "rigour and an open mind"
   - Sufficient information to properly assess impact
   - Non-delegation without proper oversight

2. **Absence of Equality Impact Assessment** - Per *R (Brown) v Secretary of State for Work and Pensions* [2008] EWHC 3158, the Council should have:
   - Identified the potential adverse impact on older residents and disabled persons
   - Considered ways to mitigate adverse impacts
   - Documented this consideration
   - Made this documentation available

3. **Continuing Duty** - The PSED is a continuing duty (*R (Baker) v Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government* [2008] EWCA Civ 141). The Council's failure to immediately remove the CAPTCHA upon notification of discriminatory impact constitutes ongoing breach.

#### 2.1.3 Statutory Consultation Requirements

When conducting public consultations, the Council must comply with:

##### Common Law Duties:
- The Gunning/Sedley Principles (*R v Brent LBC, ex p Gunning* [1985] and affirmed in *R (Moseley) v Haringey LBC* [2014] UKSC 56)
- The duty of procedural fairness (*Bank Mellat v HM Treasury (No 2)* [2013] UKSC 39)
- The principle against fettering discretion (*British Oxygen Co Ltd v Minister of Technology* [1971] AC 610)

##### Statutory Framework:
- Local Government Act 1972, s.102(4) - Duty to ensure committees discharge functions properly
- Local Government Act 1999, s.3(2) - Best Value duty requiring consultation with representatives of persons liable to pay council tax
- Localism Act 2011, s.2 - Exercise of general power subject to public law limitations

**Specific Breach:** The mid-consultation alteration fundamentally violated the principle that consultation must be conducted with "conspicuous fairness" (*R v North and East Devon Health Authority, ex p Coughlan* [2001] QB 213).

#### 2.1.4 Digital Accessibility Obligations

The Council is bound by:

##### 1. Public Sector Bodies (Websites and Mobile Applications) (No. 2) Accessibility Regulations 2018 (SI 2018/952)
   - Regulation 4: Duty to ensure websites meet WCAG 2.1 Level AA standard
   - Regulation 6: Duty to provide accessible alternatives
   - Regulation 7: Duty to publish accessibility statement
   - Regulation 11: Enforcement by the Cabinet Office

##### 2. Equality Act 2010, s.29(7) - Duty not to discriminate in providing services to the public
   - Includes digital services (*Rowley v Secretary of State for Work and Pensions* [2007] EWCA Civ 598)
   - Anticipatory duty requiring proactive consideration

**Specific Breach:** Implementing CAPTCHA violates Regulation 4 by failing multiple WCAG 2.1 Level A criteria (see Section 9.1).

#### 2.1.5 Governance and Decision-Making Duties

##### Standing Orders and Scheme of Delegation:
The Council must operate within its adopted Standing Orders and Scheme of Delegation. A decision of this magnitude (fundamentally altering public participation methodology) likely required:
- Full Council or relevant Committee approval
- Public agenda item under Local Government Act 1972, s.100A
- Recorded vote if requested under s.100A(4)
- Minutes per s.100C and Sch.12

##### Officer Delegations:
If this decision was made under officer delegation:
- It must be within the express scope of delegation
- It must be recorded per the Openness of Local Government Bodies Regulations 2014
- It remains subject to the same legal duties

**Specific Breach:** No evidence of proper decision-making process, suggesting procedural impropriety.

#### 2.1.6 Financial and Fiduciary Duties

Under s.151 of the Local Government Act 1972, the Council must maintain proper financial governance through its Responsible Financial Officer (RFO). Relevant duties include:

##### 1. Fiduciary Duty to Taxpayers (*Bromley LBC v Greater London Council* [1983] 1 AC 768)
   - Duty not to waste public resources on flawed consultations
   - Duty to obtain value for money

##### 2. Audit Requirements (Local Audit and Accountability Act 2014)
   - Duty to maintain proper records of decisions
   - Duty to demonstrate proper use of resources

**Specific Breach:** Contaminating expensive consultation data constitutes potential waste of public funds.

#### 2.1.7 Transparency and Information Duties

The Council is subject to:

##### 1. Freedom of Information Act 2000
   - s.19: Duty to maintain Publication Scheme
   - s.1: Duty to provide information on request

##### 2. Local Government Transparency Code 2015
   - Mandatory publication of decisions
   - Publication of contracts and expenditure

##### 3. Data Protection Act 2018 / UK GDPR
   - Article 5(1)(a): Lawfulness, fairness and transparency
   - Article 13: Information to be provided to data subjects
   - Article 35: Data Protection Impact Assessment for high-risk processing

**Specific Breach:** No evidence of transparency regarding the CAPTCHA decision or its impact on data processing.

#### 2.1.8 Code of Conduct Obligations

##### Members' Code of Conduct:
Under s.27 of the Localism Act 2011, the Council must have adopted a Code of Conduct. The LGA Model Code 2020 (if adopted) includes:
- Treating others with respect (para 1.1)
- Not bringing office into disrepute (para 1.2)
- Acting in accordance with legal obligations (para 2.1)

##### Officers' Code of Conduct:
Officers are bound by:
- The Employee Code of Conduct (Local Government Act 1972, s.112)
- Professional body codes where applicable (CIPFA, SOLACE, etc.)
- The Seven Principles of Public Life (Nolan Principles)

**Specific Breach:** Implementing discriminatory barriers potentially violates respect, integrity, and openness principles.

#### 2.1.9 Monitoring Officer Duties

Under s.5 of the Local Government and Housing Act 1989, the Monitoring Officer has a **personal statutory duty** to report on:
- Contraventions of law
- Maladministration
- Injustice

The Monitoring Officer's failure to act on this matter may constitute breach of their statutory duty, creating personal liability.

#### 2.1.10 Vicarious and Direct Liability

The Council faces potential liability under:

##### 1. Direct Discrimination Claims (Equality Act 2010, Part 9)
   - County Court proceedings for discrimination in services
   - Potential awards for injury to feelings (Vento bands: £1,100-£54,700)

##### 2. Judicial Review (CPR Part 54)
   - Mandatory orders to re-run consultation
   - Declarations of unlawfulness
   - Potential costs liability

##### 3. Ombudsman Findings
   - Maladministration with injustice
   - Recommended payments and remedies
   - Published reports causing reputational damage

##### 4. Criminal Liability (s.29JA Equality Act 2010)
   - Potential prosecution for instructing discrimination
   - Individual officer liability

#### 2.1.11 Conclusion on Council's Position

Swanage Town Council's request for CAPTCHA implementation demonstrates multiple, simultaneous breaches of statutory duties. The Council cannot shelter behind claims of:
- Following technical advice (non-delegable duties)
- Responding to security concerns (disproportionate response)
- Protecting consultation integrity (actually destroyed integrity)

The documented evidence of the Council's direct request, combined with the absence of any equality impact assessment or proper governance process, establishes a *prima facie* case of:
- Unlawful discrimination
- Breach of public sector equality duty
- Maladministration
- Ultra vires action
- Potential misfeasance in public office

These are not merely technical breaches but fundamental failures of public administration that strike at the heart of democratic participation and equal treatment under law.

## 2.2 Dorset Coast Forum: Agent Obligations

### 2.2.1 Contractual Status and Agency Relationship

Dorset Coast Forum (DCF) operates as the contracted agent of Swanage Town Council for the administration of the Shore Road public consultation. As confirmed in correspondence from Ms. Toni Powell, DCF acts as the primary project manager and intermediary between the Council and technical service providers.

Under the principles of agency law (*Bowstead & Reynolds on Agency*, 22nd Ed.), DCF owes duties both to:
- **The Principal** (Swanage Town Council) - fiduciary duties and contractual obligations
- **Third Parties** (the public) - duties in tort and under equality legislation

The scope of DCF's authority appears to include operational decisions regarding survey administration, but this authority cannot extend to implementing discriminatory practices, as an agent cannot have authority to commit unlawful acts (*Hilton v Barker Booth & Eastwood* [2005] UKHL 8).

### 2.2.2 Professional Standards and Due Diligence

#### Community Engagement Standards

As a professional consultation facilitator, DCF is expected to adhere to:
- **The Consultation Institute's Charter** - requiring inclusive, accessible engagement
- **International Association for Public Participation (IAP2) Standards** - emphasising barrier-free participation
- **Market Research Society Code of Conduct** - requiring fair and representative data collection

DCF's failure to advise against or prevent discriminatory barriers constitutes a breach of professional standards and potentially professional negligence.

#### Due Diligence Obligations

DCF had a duty to:
1. **Assess Legal Compliance** - Ensure all consultation methods comply with equality legislation
2. **Evaluate Technical Solutions** - Scrutinise proposed security measures for proportionality
3. **Monitor Implementation** - Continuously assess impact on participation rates
4. **Advise on Risks** - Warn the Council of legal and reputational risks

**Specific Breach:** DCF either failed to recognise the discriminatory nature of CAPTCHA implementation or failed to advise against it, constituting negligent performance of professional duties.

### 2.2.3 Equality Act Obligations

#### Direct Service Provider Duties

Under s.29 of the Equality Act 2010, DCF as a service provider must not discriminate against persons requiring services by:
- (a) refusing to provide the service
- (b) as to the terms on which the service is provided
- (c) terminating the provision of the service
- (d) subjecting them to any other detriment

The implementation of CAPTCHA constitutes discrimination under subsections (b) and (d).

#### Reasonable Adjustments Duty

Per s.20 and Schedule 2 of the Equality Act 2010, DCF has an anticipatory duty to make reasonable adjustments where a provision, criterion or practice puts disabled persons at a substantial disadvantage. This duty:
- Cannot be delegated or transferred
- Requires proactive consideration
- Is owed to disabled persons at large

**Specific Breach:** No evidence of reasonable adjustments being considered or implemented.

### 2.2.4 Data Controller/Processor Responsibilities

#### UK GDPR Compliance

DCF's role in data processing requires determination as either:
- **Joint Controller** (Article 26) - if determining purposes and means with the Council
- **Processor** (Article 28) - if processing solely on Council's instructions

In either capacity, DCF must ensure:
1. **Article 5 Principles** - Including fairness and transparency
2. **Article 25** - Data protection by design and default
3. **Article 32** - Appropriate technical and organisational measures

**Specific Breach:** Implementing CAPTCHA mid-survey violates fairness principle and retroactively changes the basis of processing.

#### Data Quality Obligations

DCF has a professional duty to ensure data integrity for the consultation's validity. By implementing a measure that creates selection bias, DCF has:
- Breached implied terms of fitness for purpose
- Failed to deliver professional services with reasonable skill and care
- Potentially committed negligent misstatement if presenting contaminated data as valid

### 2.2.5 Tortious Liability

#### Negligence

DCF owes a duty of care to consultation participants under *Caparo Industries plc v Dickman* [1990] 2 AC 605:
1. **Foreseeability** - Harm to elderly/disabled users was foreseeable
2. **Proximity** - Direct relationship with service users
3. **Fair, Just and Reasonable** - Public policy supports imposing duty

The standard of care is that of a reasonable professional consultation facilitator (*Bolam v Friern Hospital Management Committee* [1957] 1 WLR 582, as modified by *Montgomery v Lanarkshire Health Board* [2015] UKSC 11).

#### Misfeasance in Public Office

If DCF officers knew the CAPTCHA would discriminate but proceeded anyway, potential liability exists for misfeasance in public office (*Three Rivers DC v Bank of England (No 3)* [2003] 2 AC 1).

### 2.2.6 Contractual Liability

#### To Swanage Town Council

DCF likely breached implied terms including:
- **Reasonable skill and care** (Supply of Goods and Services Act 1982, s.13)
- **Fitness for purpose** (contaminated data is unfit for policy-making)
- **Compliance with law** (implied term not to cause principal to breach statutory duties)

#### Third Party Rights

Under the Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999, affected residents may have enforceable rights if the contract purported to benefit them.

### 2.2.7 Indemnity and Insurance Considerations

DCF's professional indemnity insurance may not cover:
- Deliberate discriminatory acts
- Breach of statutory duties
- Criminal prosecutions under s.29JA Equality Act 2010

This exposure creates significant financial risk for DCF and its officers personally.

## 2.3 Granicus UK Ltd: Service Provider Duties

### 2.3.1 Corporate Status and Regulatory Framework

Granicus UK Ltd operates as:
- **Company Number:** [To be confirmed from Companies House]
- **Registered Office:** [To be confirmed]
- **Parent Company:** Granicus LLC (US entity)
- **UK Establishment:** Subject to UK law for services provided in the UK

As a provider of digital services to UK public bodies, Granicus is subject to:
- UK equality legislation
- UK data protection law
- UK public procurement regulations
- UK consumer protection law

### 2.3.2 Government Digital Service (GDS) Standards

As a supplier to UK government bodies, Granicus should comply with:

#### Service Standard

The GDS Service Standard requires:
- **Point 5:** "Make sure everyone can use the service" - requiring WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
- **Point 6:** "Have a multidisciplinary team" - including accessibility expertise
- **Point 10:** "Define what success looks like" - including accessibility metrics
- **Point 14:** "Operate a reliable service" - including for users with accessibility needs

#### Technology Code of Practice

Requires:
- Accessibility as a core consideration
- Progressive enhancement approach
- Regular accessibility testing
- User needs over organisational convenience

**Specific Breach:** Implementing CAPTCHA violates multiple GDS standards Granicus claims to support.

### 2.3.3 Digital Service Provider Obligations

#### Public Sector Accessibility Regulations

While Granicus is not directly bound by the Public Sector Bodies (Websites and Mobile Applications) (No. 2) Accessibility Regulations 2018, they have:
- **Accessory Liability** - for enabling public bodies to breach regulations
- **Professional Negligence** - for failing to ensure compliance
- **Procurement Risk** - future exclusion from public contracts

#### Crown Commercial Service Frameworks

If operating under CCS frameworks (G-Cloud, DOS, etc.), Granicus must:
- Maintain accessibility standards
- Provide accessible solutions by default
- Support public sector compliance

**Specific Breach:** Providing non-compliant solutions breaches framework terms.

### 2.3.4 Professional Negligence and Standards

#### Industry Standards

Granicus holds itself out as a specialist GovTech provider, creating heightened duties:
- **ISO/IEC 40500:2012** (WCAG 2.0) - International accessibility standard
- **BS 8878:2010** - Web accessibility code of practice
- **ISO/IEC 25010:2011** - System quality models including accessibility

#### Duty of Care to End Users

Following *Henderson v Merrett Syndicates Ltd* [1995] 2 AC 145, Granicus may owe concurrent duties in:
- **Contract** - to their client (DCF/Council)
- **Tort** - to end users who rely on the service

The assumption of responsibility for providing public consultation infrastructure creates direct duties to participants.

### 2.3.5 Equality Act Compliance

#### Information Society Service Provider

As a provider of information society services, Granicus falls under:
- **S.29 Equality Act 2010** - prohibition on discrimination in services
- **Schedule 25** - specific provisions for information society services
- **Equality Act 2010 (Disability) Regulations 2010** - accessibility requirements

#### Platform Liability

While traditionally platforms claim mere conduit status, Granicus's active role in:
- Recommending security measures
- Implementing changes
- Controlling access methods

Creates potential direct liability for discriminatory outcomes.

### 2.3.6 Data Protection Obligations

#### Processor vs Controller Analysis

Granicus likely operates as a Data Processor under Article 4(8) UK GDPR, with obligations including:
- **Article 28** - Processing only on documented instructions
- **Article 32** - Implementing appropriate security measures
- **Article 33** - Notification of personal data breaches
- **Article 5(1)(f)** - Ensuring integrity and confidentiality

#### Security Measures Proportionality

Article 32 requires security measures that are "appropriate" considering:
- State of the art
- Costs of implementation
- Nature, scope, context and purposes
- Risks to rights and freedoms

**Specific Breach:** CAPTCHA is disproportionate to the actual security risk and creates new risks to rights (discrimination).

### 2.3.7 Competition and Consumer Law

#### Unfair Trading Regulations

Under the Consumer Protection from Unfair Trading Regulations 2008:
- **Misleading Actions** - if Granicus marketed the platform as accessible
- **Misleading Omissions** - failing to disclose accessibility barriers
- **Professional Diligence** - falling below expected standards

#### Competition Act 1998

If Granicus holds significant market power in GovTech, implementing discriminatory features could constitute:
- Abuse of dominant position
- Anti-competitive practices

### 2.3.8 Contractual and Commercial Implications

#### Service Level Agreements

Standard SLAs likely include:
- Availability targets
- Performance metrics
- Compliance requirements

**Specific Breach:** Accessibility barriers violate implied availability for all users.

#### Warranties and Representations

Typical warranties include:
- Compliance with applicable laws
- Fitness for purpose
- Non-infringement of third party rights

**Specific Breach:** Providing discriminatory tools breaches legal compliance warranties.

### 2.3.9 US Parent Company Considerations

#### Federal Requirements

As a US entity serving government, Granicus LLC must consider:
- **Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act** - US federal accessibility requirements
- **Americans with Disabilities Act** - potential extraterritorial application
- **FedRAMP Authorization** - includes accessibility requirements

Failure to maintain accessibility standards could jeopardise US government contracts.

#### Sarbanes-Oxley Implications

If publicly traded, accessibility failures creating legal liability constitute material risks requiring disclosure under SOX.

## 2.4 Chain of Liability and Professional Obligations

### 2.4.1 Primary Liability Framework

#### Statutory Non-Delegable Duties

Certain duties cannot be delegated regardless of contractual arrangements:

**Swanage Town Council** retains primary liability for:
- Public Sector Equality Duty (s.149 Equality Act 2010)
- Consultation fairness (Gunning Principles)
- Data controller obligations (UK GDPR)
- Statutory functions (Local Government Act 1972)

These duties remain with the Council even when using agents or contractors (*R (Rowe) v Vale of White Horse DC* [2003] EWHC 388).

#### Joint and Several Liability

All three parties face potential joint and several liability for:
- **Discrimination claims** - each contributed to the discriminatory act
- **Data protection breaches** - joint controllers or controller/processor chain
- **Negligence** - concurrent duties of care to end users

Claimants may pursue any or all parties for full compensation.

### 2.4.2 Contributory Liability Analysis

#### Initiation of Harm

**Swanage Town Council:**
- Initiated the harmful act by requesting CAPTCHA
- Bears primary moral and legal culpability
- Cannot claim reliance on technical advice for non-delegable duties

**Dorset Coast Forum:**
- Failed gatekeeper function
- Should have advised against or refused the request
- Contributed through action or negligent omission

**Granicus UK Ltd:**
- Provided the means of discrimination
- Failed to warn or provide adequate alternatives
- Potentially encouraged through "recommendation"

### 2.4.3 Vicarious and Accessory Liability

#### Vicarious Liability Principles

Per *Various Claimants v Catholic Child Welfare Society* [2012] UKSC 56:
1. Employer/principal relationship
2. Sufficient connection between relationship and tort
3. Fair, just and reasonable to impose liability

**Application:**
- Council vicariously liable for DCF's acts as agent
- DCF potentially liable for sub-contractor acts
- Individual officers may face personal liability

#### Accessory Liability

Under s.112 Equality Act 2010:
- Individuals who aid discrimination face personal liability
- Employers liable for employee discriminatory acts
- Principals liable for agent discriminatory acts

**Defences** under s.109-111 require showing:
- Reasonable steps to prevent discrimination
- Good faith reliance on statements
- Lack of knowledge or approval

### 2.4.4 Indemnity and Contribution

#### Civil Liability (Contribution) Act 1978

Parties may seek contribution from each other based on:
- Respective responsibility for damage
- What is "just and equitable"
- Causative potency and blameworthiness

**Likely Apportionment:**
- Council: 50-60% (initiated and controlled)
- DCF: 20-30% (failed professional duties)
- Granicus: 20-30% (enabled and failed to prevent)

#### Contractual Indemnities

Standard contracts likely include:
- Cross-indemnities for negligent acts
- Exclusions for deliberate breaches
- Insurance requirements

**Note:** Indemnities for discrimination may be void as contrary to public policy.

### 2.4.5 Regulatory Enforcement Matrix

Different regulators may pursue different parties:

| **Regulator** | **Council** | **DCF** | **Granicus** | **Powers** |
|---------------|-------------|---------|--------------|------------|
| **EHRC** | Primary target | Secondary | Secondary | Investigation, agreement, enforcement |
| **ICO** | Data controller | Joint/processor | Processor | Assessment, enforcement notice, fine |
| **LGO** | Sole target | N/A | N/A | Investigation, recommendations |
| **Cabinet Office** | Primary target | Advisory | Advisory | Monitoring, enforcement notice |
| **CMA** | Unlikely | Unlikely | Possible | Investigation, directions |

### 2.4.6 Criminal Liability Distribution

#### Section 29JA Equality Act 2010

Criminal liability for instructing discrimination:
- **Council officers** - if knowingly instructed discrimination
- **DCF officers** - if knowingly implemented discrimination
- **Granicus staff** - if knowingly facilitated discrimination

#### Corporate Manslaughter

Unlikely but theoretically possible if discrimination led to death (e.g., emergency services information).

### 2.4.7 Reputational Damage Allocation

#### Direct Reputational Harm

**Swanage Town Council:**
- Local democratic legitimacy undermined
- Trust in consultation processes destroyed
- Political consequences for councillors

**Dorset Coast Forum:**
- Professional reputation as consultation expert damaged
- Future contract opportunities reduced
- Professional body sanctions possible

**Granicus UK Ltd:**
- Market position as accessibility-compliant provider undermined
- Public sector framework status threatened
- Parent company US government contracts at risk

#### Contagion Risk

Each party's reputation affects others:
- Council tainted by association with discriminatory providers
- DCF viewed as incompetent for choosing/accepting Granicus
- Granicus seen as predatory for exploiting unsophisticated clients

### 2.4.8 Mitigation and Remediation Responsibilities

#### Immediate Actions Required

**All Parties Jointly:**
1. Remove CAPTCHA immediately
2. Issue public apology
3. Extend consultation period
4. Provide alternative submission methods

**Council Specifically:**
1. Conduct retroactive Equality Impact Assessment
2. Report to Monitoring Officer
3. Inform affected residents
4. Consider re-running consultation

**DCF Specifically:**
1. Audit all other consultations for similar issues
2. Implement accessibility checking protocols
3. Retain accessibility expert
4. Review professional procedures

**Granicus Specifically:**
1. Platform-wide accessibility audit
2. Implement mandatory accessibility checking
3. Revise client advisory protocols
4. Develop accessibility-first security alternatives

### 2.4.9 Professional Body Sanctions

#### Potential Professional Consequences

**Council Officers:**
- CIPFA/SOLACE investigation for finance/governance officers
- RTPI sanctions for planning officers
- Personal liability under s.5 LG&HA 1989 (Monitoring Officer)

**DCF Staff:**
- Consultation Institute membership review
- Market Research Society investigation
- IAP2 ethics review

**Granicus Staff:**
- BCS (Chartered Institute for IT) investigation
- ISO certification reviews
- Professional indemnity insurance implications

### 2.4.10 Precedent and Systemic Impact

This case establishes concerning precedents:

#### Legal Precedents
- Public bodies can discriminate through technical measures
- Contractors can evade responsibility through liability chains
- Affected citizens face complex multi-party litigation

#### Market Precedents
- GovTech providers can profit from discrimination
- Accessibility becomes optional under "security" justification
- Public consultations become exclusionary by design

#### Policy Implications
- Democratic participation restricted to technical elites
- Digital-first policies systematically exclude vulnerable groups
- Equality duties subordinated to administrative convenience

### 2.4.11 Conclusion on Liability

The attempt to diffuse responsibility across multiple parties does not diminish individual culpability. Each party:
- Had independent duties to prevent discrimination
- Failed to exercise professional judgment
- Contributed to cumulative harm

The complexity of the contractual chain cannot be used as a shield against liability. Courts and regulators consistently hold that:
- Non-delegable duties remain with public bodies
- Professional service providers must maintain standards
- Technical providers cannot enable discrimination

All three parties face significant legal, financial, and reputational consequences. The interconnected nature of their failures creates a cascade of liability that exposes each to maximum consequences rather than providing mutual protection.
