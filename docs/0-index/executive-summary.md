# Executive Summary

## At‑a‑glance
- **Core issue**: A mid‑consultation CAPTCHA change created an accessibility barrier that likely excluded elderly and disabled residents from responding.
- **Impact**: Participation bias undermined statistical validity; decisions based on the consultation are unsafe and at risk of challenge.
- **Why it matters**: Multiple duties were engaged and likely breached (Equality Act, PSED, consultation fairness, data protection by design, and accessibility standards).
- **What we seek**: Remove barriers, re‑run an accessible consultation with alternatives, acknowledge the issue, and publish assessments and remediation commitments.

## What happened (chronology snapshot)
- A CAPTCHA barrier was introduced part‑way through the consultation window, altering access conditions and response friction.
- The change was not communicated with appropriate mitigation or alternatives, leading to a step‑change in accessibility and participation patterns.
- Submissions from affected groups dropped or were deterred, invalidating comparability over time.

## Who was affected and how
- **Elderly and disabled residents**: Disproportionate exclusion due to CAPTCHA, contravening the duty to make reasonable adjustments and WCAG expectations.
- **Digitally excluded**: Residents relying on assisted digital support or alternative channels were not provided equivalent means in time.
- **Wider community**: Consultation outputs no longer reflect the affected population; policy legitimacy is diminished.

## Why this is likely unlawful (legal summary)
- **Equality Act (reasonable adjustments; PSED)**: Failure to anticipate and accommodate known accessibility barriers; lack of timely mitigations.
- **Consultation law (Gunning principles)**: Fairness compromised where consultees could not meaningfully participate throughout the period.
- **Data protection by design (GDPR Article 25)**: Inadequate risk assessment for accessibility/participation impacts of CAPTCHA deployment.
- **Accessibility (WCAG)**: CAPTCHA use without accessible alternatives conflicts with WCAG 2.x success criteria and government guidance.
- **Sector frameworks**: Local government/public authority standards require accessible engagement and inclusive decision‑making.

See: [Equality Act](../3-legal-regulatory/07-equality-act-violations.md), [Public Law Fairness](../3-legal-regulatory/08-public-law-failures.md), [WCAG](../3-legal-regulatory/09-wcag-violations.md), [Data Protection & Privacy](../3-legal-regulatory/10-data-protection-privacy.md), [Local Government Framework](../3-legal-regulatory/11-local-government-framework.md), [Professional Standards](../3-legal-regulatory/12-professional-standards-violations.md), [Liability & Remedies](../3-legal-regulatory/liability-and-remedies.md)

## Technical analysis highlights
- **Security technologies misapplied**: CAPTCHA introduced without user‑centric threat modeling or accessibility accommodation.
- **Software engineering failures**: Change management lacked impact analysis, comms plan, or rollback/alternatives.
- **Statistical validity**: Time‑series discontinuity and selection bias render comparative metrics unreliable.

## Evidence base (where to verify)
- **Primary documents**: Notices, consultation materials, change logs, correspondence.
- **Expert analysis**: Methodological and legal assessments corroborating impacts and risks.
- **Comparative cases**: Precedents and sector guidance highlighting required controls.

## Immediate actions requested
1. Remove or fully accommodate CAPTCHA with accessible alternatives and assisted channels.
2. Publicly acknowledge the barrier and publish an Equality/Accessibility impact addendum.
3. Re‑run the consultation (or the affected phase) with accessible-by-design controls and equivalent non‑digital routes.
4. Offer targeted support to previously excluded groups; extend timelines accordingly.
5. Commit to independent audit of consultation design, data integrity, and accessibility.

## Remediation plan (summary)
- **Harm assessment**: Quantify exclusion, bias, and decision risk. See [Harm & Damage Assessment (13)](../4-harm-remedies/13-harm-damage-assessment.md).
- **Actions**: Implement accessible alternatives, redo affected collection, and correct records. See [Remedial Actions (14)](../4-harm-remedies/14-remedial-actions.md).
- **Regulatory/legal steps**: Engage oversight bodies, publish rectification plans. See [Regulatory & Legal Steps (15)](../4-harm-remedies/15-regulatory-legal-steps.md).

## Risks if unaddressed
- Policy decisions built on invalid data are exposed to legal challenge and public trust erosion.
- Continued non‑compliance risks regulatory action and reputational harm.
- Missed opportunity to collect representative, high‑quality evidence for decision‑making.
- **Risk of "Strategic Sidestep":** Simply voiding the consultation does not remedy the underlying breach of the Public Sector Equality Duty. The council has a positive obligation to properly consult and re-engage with the residents who were unlawfully excluded.

## Our Three Core Demands

1. **Immediate CAPTCHA Removal and Apology:** Remove all accessibility barriers immediately and issue a public acknowledgment of the discrimination caused to elderly and disabled residents.

2. **Re-run Accessible Consultation:** Conduct a new consultation phase with guaranteed accessible methods (phone, paper, in-person assistance) and extended timelines to ensure all residents can participate.

3. **Independent Audit and Compensation:** Commission an independent accessibility audit of all council digital services and establish a compensation framework for affected residents based on Vento band guidelines.
