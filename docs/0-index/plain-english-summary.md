# Plain English Summary

- What went wrong: A puzzle (CAPTCHA) was added during the public survey. Many older and disabled people could not finish it.
- Why it matters: The results no longer show what the whole town thinks, and that is unfair and unlawful.
- What should happen now:
  1) Remove the puzzle and allow other ways to respond (email, phone, in person)
  2) Say sorry and explain what went wrong
  3) Re-run the survey in an accessible way
