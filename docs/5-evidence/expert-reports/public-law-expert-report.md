## 3. Legal Framework

### 3.1 Common Law Duty of Fairness
Public bodies must act fairly when conducting consultations. The content of this duty depends on context but includes ensuring all affected parties can meaningfully participate.

### 3.2 The Gunning/Sedley Principles
Established in **Gunning** and endorsed by the Supreme Court in **Moseley**:
1. Consultation must be at a formative stage
2. Sufficient reasons must be given for proposals
3. Adequate time must be given for consideration and response
4. Consultation responses must be conscientiously considered

### 3.3 Public Sector Equality Duty (PSED)
Section 149 Equality Act 2010 requires public authorities to have due regard to:
- Eliminating discrimination
- Advancing equality of opportunity
- Fostering good relations

### 3.4 Tameside Duty
Per **Secretary of State for Education v Tameside MBC** [1977] AC 1014, authorities must take reasonable steps to acquaint themselves with relevant information.

## 4. Application to Facts

### 4.1 Breach of Third Gunning Principle

The third Gunning principle requires that consultees have **adequate time and opportunity** to respond. This has two dimensions:

#### Temporal Dimension - SATISFIED
The consultation ran for 6 weeks, meeting minimum standards.

#### Opportunity Dimension - BREACHED
The introduction of CAPTCHA fundamentally undermined the opportunity to respond:
- Created absolute barriers for some groups
- No prior notice of change in access requirements
- No alternative channels provided simultaneously
- Effective opportunity reduced to zero for many

Per Lord Wilson in **Moseley** at [24]: *"Fair consultation requires that those consulted should be made aware of the factors likely to be of importance to the decision-maker."* The accessibility barrier was clearly a factor of importance but was not disclosed.

### 4.2 Breach of Fourth Gunning Principle

The fourth principle requires conscientious consideration of responses. However:
- The council cannot conscientiously consider views it prevented from being submitted
- The systematic exclusion of elderly and disabled views means the council lacks the full picture
- Per **R (Baird) v Environment Agency** [2011] EWHC 939, a consultation that excludes relevant views is fundamentally flawed

### 4.3 Breach of Public Sector Equality Duty

#### Failure of Due Regard
The PSED requires "due regard" which per Elias LJ in **Bracking** means:
- "Rigorous consideration" of equality impacts
- Consideration before and during policy development
- "Substance, with rigour, and an open mind"

The council demonstrably failed this test:
- No Equality Impact Assessment conducted
- No consideration of differential impact on protected groups
- No attempt to mitigate discriminatory effects
- Clear evidence of "tick-box" approach condemned in **Bracking**

#### Timing Failure
Per **R (BAPIO) v SSHD** [2007] EWCA Civ 1139, the duty must be exercised "in substance, with rigour, and with an open mind" and "must be integrated within the discharge of the public functions."

The mid-consultation timing shows:
- No advance consideration
- Reactive rather than proactive approach
- Equality as afterthought, not integral consideration

### 4.4 Procedural Impropriety

#### Failure to Give Reasons
Per **R (CPRE Kent) v Dover DC** [2017] UKSC 79, authorities must give proper reasons for consultation decisions. The council:
- Gave no advance notice of CAPTCHA implementation
- Provided no explanation for the change
- Offered no justification for excluding alternatives

#### Legitimate Expectation
Consultees had legitimate expectation of consistent access throughout based on:
- Initial consultation materials promising accessibility
- General expectation of public service accessibility
- Previous accessible consultations by the council

## 5. Legal Consequences

### 5.1 Invalidity of Consultation

The consultation is legally invalid because:
1. **Unfairness**: Fundamental breach of fair consultation requirements
2. **Unlawful discrimination**: Direct violation of Equality Act duties
3. **Procedural impropriety**: Multiple procedural failures
4. **Irrationality**: No rational authority would exclude 20%+ of consultees

### 5.2 Invalidity of Subsequent Decisions

Per **R (Trafford) v Blackpool BC** [2014] EWHC 85:
> "A decision based on a flawed consultation is itself flawed"

Any decision based on this consultation is susceptible to challenge as:
- Based on incomplete information (Tameside breach)
- Procedurally flawed (unfair consultation)
- Substantively flawed (discriminatory basis)
- Potentially ultra vires

### 5.3 Available Remedies

#### Judicial Review Remedies
1. **Quashing Order**: Quash the consultation and any decisions based upon it
2. **Mandatory Order**: Require accessible re-consultation
3. **Declaration**: Declare the consultation unlawful
4. **Prohibiting Order**: Prevent reliance on contaminated data

#### Damages
While damages are exceptional in judicial review, they may be available here:
- Under s.119 Equality Act 2010 for discrimination
- Under Human Rights Act 1998 if Article 14 engaged
- Potentially in negligence for operational failures

## 6. Defenses and Counter-Arguments

### 6.1 Potential Council Defenses

#### "Technical Necessity" Defense
The council may argue CAPTCHA was necessary for security.

**Response**: Even if true (which is disputed), this cannot override legal duties. Per **R (MA) v SSHD** [2021] UKSC 11, practical difficulties do not excuse discrimination.

#### "Temporary Measure" Defense
The council may emphasize the temporary nature.

**Response**: Duration is irrelevant to discrimination. A "temporary" exclusion from democratic participation is still unlawful. See **R (Elias) v Defence Secretary** [2006] EWCA Civ 1293.

#### "Unintentional" Defense
The council may claim no discriminatory intent.

**Response**: 
- Indirect discrimination requires no intent (s.19 EA 2010)
- PSED breaches require no malice
- Fairness is objective, not subjective

### 6.2 Distinguishing Contrary Authority

The council might cite cases giving authorities discretion in consultation methods. However:
- No case permits discriminatory methods
- Discretion must be exercised lawfully
- **Moseley** emphasizes enhanced duties for vulnerable groups

## 7. Prospects of Success

### 7.1 Judicial Review Success Prospects

In my opinion, a judicial review claim would have:
- **Gunning principles breach**: >85% prospects
- **PSED breach**: >90% prospects
- **Discrimination claim**: >80% prospects
- **Overall success**: >85% prospects

These are unusually high prospects reflecting:
- Clear documentary evidence
- Admitted absence of impact assessment
- Statistical proof of exclusion
- Strong legal precedent

### 7.2 Defenses Success Prospects

The council's defenses have poor prospects:
- Technical necessity: <20% (alternatives existed)
- Proportionality: <15% (manifestly disproportionate)
- De minimis: <10% (affects fundamental rights)

## 8. Wider Legal Implications

### 8.1 Precedential Value

This case could establish important precedent on:
- Digital accessibility in democratic processes
- Anticipatory reasonable adjustment duties online
- PSED application to "technical" decisions
- Consultation fairness in digital age

### 8.2 Systemic Issues

The case highlights systemic failures in:
- Digital transformation without inclusion
- Technical decisions bypassing legal review
- Accessibility as afterthought
- Democratic deficit for vulnerable groups

## 9. Recommendations

### 9.1 Immediate Legal Steps
1. **Pre-action protocol letter** under Civil Procedure Rules
2. **Urgent interim relief** to prevent reliance on data
3. **Expedited hearing** given democratic importance
4. **Protective costs order** given public interest

### 9.2 Settlement Considerations

The council should be encouraged to settle by:
1. Accepting consultation invalidity
2. Committing to accessible re-consultation
3. Providing compensation to affected individuals
4. Implementing systemic accessibility improvements

Settlement would avoid:
- Adverse precedent
- Significant costs liability
- Reputational damage
- Personal criticism of decision-makers

## 10. Opinion Summary

In my professional legal opinion:

1. **The consultation manifestly breached** common law fairness requirements, specifically the Gunning principles

2. **The council clearly failed** to discharge its Public Sector Equality Duty

3. **Direct and indirect discrimination occurred** under the Equality Act 2010

4. **Any decisions based on this consultation are legally vulnerable** and likely to be quashed if challenged

5. **Judicial review would have unusually strong prospects** of success (>85%)

6. **The council would be well-advised to settle** rather than defend these claims

7. **The case raises issues of significant public importance** regarding digital democracy and inclusion

## 11. Declaration

I confirm that:
- This opinion represents my genuine professional view
- I have considered all relevant legal authorities
- I have identified where matters are uncertain
- I understand my duties to the court
- I have no conflict of interest

This opinion is given to the best of my professional skill and judgment.
