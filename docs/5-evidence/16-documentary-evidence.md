# 16. Documentary Evidence

## 16.1 Email Correspondence: Toni Powell Admission

The following correspondence is central to establishing the origin of the request for the CAPTCHA implementation.

> **[PLACEHOLDER: Insert direct, verbatim quote from the key sentence of the Toni Powell email here. For example: "Further to our conversation, I can confirm the council has requested that a CAPTCHA be implemented..."]**

**Analysis and Corroboration:**
This statement constitutes a direct admission that the request to implement the discriminatory barrier originated from the client (Swanage Town Council), not the technical providers. This is critical in assigning primary liability under the Equality Act 2010 and refutes any potential defense that the council was merely accepting a technical recommendation. This evidence is corroborated by the system change logs, which show the CAPTCHA was implemented shortly after the date of this correspondence.
